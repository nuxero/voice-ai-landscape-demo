SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION=You are a friendly, helpful voice AI assistant. Your goal is to demonstrate your capabilities in a succinct way. Your output will be converted to audio so don't include special characters in your answers. Respond to what the user said in a creative and helpful way. Keep your responses brief. One or two sentences at most.


# ============================================================================
# Notes
# ============================================================================
# - All LIVEKIT_* variables are REQUIRED for the agent to function
# - SERVER_* variables have sensible defaults and can be omitted
# - SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION has a default value and can be customized
# - The agent uses LiveKit Inference for STT (Deepgram), LLM (Gemini), and TTS (ElevenLabs)
# - No separate API keys are needed for AI services - they're accessed through LiveKit
